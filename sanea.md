### Pitch Accent

Sanea has a pitch accent, internally known as *vammati* or "musical speech", where the word has a high pitch on the penultimate syllable and a low pitch on all preceding syllables. However, the pitch shifts to a low pitch on all syllables apart from the final syllable when in its definite form. Here's an example:
* *koíkar* [koíkaɾ] "mouth" -> *koikár* [koikáɾ] "the mouth"

Words with only one syllable automatically have a low tone, but a high tone in their definite:
* *miz* [miz] "house" -> *míz* [míz] "the house"

Note that acute accents such as in *koíkar* and *míz* are not normally written outside of educational circumstances to explain the pitch accent to others. They are normally written without any diacritics no matter the context.

Words with a circumflex tone (rising-falling) keep their tone but rise again on the ultimate syllable:
* *hŷmmoi* [hœ́œ̀mːoi̯] "speed" -> *hŷmmoí* [hœ́œ̀mːói̯] "the speed"

Monosyllabic words with a rising-falling tone will instead have a falling-rising tone:
* *ûs* [úùs] "controller" -> *ũs* [ùús] "the controller"

Words with a rising-falling tone on the ultimate syllable will instead be replaced with a high tone:
* *nohûd* [nohúùd] "suggestion" -> *nohụd* [nohúːd] "the suggestion"

### Phonological Processes
Fortition reverses at the beginnings of root words after a prefix has been assigned to them, such as words that historically started with /s/ or /z/:
* *timmi* [tímːi] (<- Sumre *simmė* [símːe]) becomes *asimmi* [àsímːi] in its dual form
* *dor* [doɾ] (<- Sumre *zur* [zúɾ]) becomes *azor* [ázòɾ] in its dual form

/j/ will also become /ɲ/ before /i/:
* *bèhoyen* "to craft; make" -> *bèhoñik* "you all crafted; made"

## Nouns

### Case
Sanea has only 1 noun case, the nominative case, the accusative was replaced by definiteness.

### Declension
Sanea only declines based on number, there are dual and plural forms:
* *tímmi* [tímːi] "a language" -> *asímmi* [àtímːi] "a couple languages" -> *timmíru* [tìmːíɾu] "many languages"

## Verbs

### Conjugation

Sanea conjugates verbs based on person, which is a feature specific to the Sumric subfamily, the rest of the Sermaa language family conjugates based on tense, and the rest of the Sumric subfamily either conjugate personally or don't conjugate at all. In Sanea's system, the 1st and 2nd person conjugations are identical in their singular form, here's are some examples (official accentuation in parentheses):

*torroyen (torróyen)* [toɾ̥ójen] - "to love"
* **1SG / 2SG** -> *torroyè (torróyè)* [toɾ̥ójeː] - "I love / you love"
* **3SG** -> *torroyar (torróyar)* [toɾ̥ójaɾ] - "he/she/it loves"

Let's take a look at the plural forms with another verb:

*darrizen (darrízen)* [daɾ̥ízɛn] - "to apologize"
* **1PL** -> *darrizo (darrízo)* [daɾ̥ízo] - "we apologize"
* **2PL** -> *darrizea (darrizéa)* [daɾ̥izéa] - "you all apologize"
* **3PL** -> *darrizyr (darrízyr)* [daɾ̥ízœɾ ~ daɾ̥ízʌɾ] - "they apologize"

#### Past Tense
Sanea's simple past is conjugated as so:

*bèhoyen (bèhóyen)* [bɛːhójen] "to craft; make"
* **1SG** -> *bèhoyak* "I crafted; made"
* **2SG** -> *bèhoyek* "you crafted; made"
* **3SG** -> *bèhoyarak (bèhoyárak)* "he/she/it crafted; made"

Plural forms:
* **1PL** -> *bèhoyok* "we crafted; made"
* **2PL** -> *bèhoñik* "you all crafted; made"
* **3PL** -> *bèhoik* "they crafted; made"
