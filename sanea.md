### Pitch Accent

Sanea has a pitch accent, internally known as *vammati* or "musical speech", where the word has a high pitch on the penultimate syllable and a low pitch on all preceding syllables. However, the pitch shifts to a low pitch on all syllables apart from the final syllable when in its definitive form. Here's an example:
* *koíkar* [koíkaɾ] "mouth" -> *koikár* [koikáɾ] "the mouth"

Words with only one syllable automatically have a low tone, but a high tone in their definitive:
* *miz* [miz] "house" -> *míz* [míz] "the house"

Note that acute accents such as in *koíkar* and *míz* are not normally written outside of educational circumstances to explain the pitch accent to others. They are normally written without any diacritics no matter the context.
