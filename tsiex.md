### Stress
Tsiex is one of the only Sumric languages (and overall, Sermaa languages) which uses stress instead of a pitch accent, although it works very similarly to the historic pitch accent:
* Stress lands on the penultimate syllable
* In the case that there is a long vowel in a word, stress always lands on the long vowel
* If there are multiple syllables in which a long vowel is present, stress will land on the earliest-occurring.

### Phonological Processes
Tsiex has a unique phonological process in which historic word-final /s/ was converted to /ʃ/, but then reverts back to /t͡s/ when not word-final:
* *tšigaš* [ˈtʃigaʃ] "month" -> *tšigatsó* [tʃigaˈtsoː] "month (obl.)"

## Nouns
### Case
Tsiex has 3 noun cases:
* **Nominative**: marks the subject
* **Oblique**: marks the indirect *and* direct objects
* **Genitive**: marks possession

Here's an example of a regular noun in these cases, *tsmoš* "woman":
* **Nominative**: *tsmoš*
* **Oblique**: *tsmotsó*
* **Genitive**: *tsmotsa*

There are some words (primarily ending in -ie) which do not decline at all due to their irregular nature, such as *dzúnie* "priest":
* **Nominative**: *dzúnie*
* **Oblique**: *dzúnie*
* **Genitive**: *dzúnie*
